    <h3>What we do</h3>
    <p>
      Since the establishment of the Overberg Toyota Owners Club in 2019,
      the club has joined more than 20 car club rallies and has hosted one of their own.
      The club has held numerous soup kitchens in the most poverty struck areas in the Overberg region.
      There are also many fund raisers like car washes and carnivals that the club has hosted.
      The funds raised by these fund raisers have all gone to charities based in the Overberg region like GOD SHIFT ERA
      NPC and ANIMA Childrens Therapy Centre.
      The club does many other activities where the club members come together to show off their love
      for their cars as well as their love for their fellow car enthusiasts.
      One of these activities is the annual breakfast run that the club has every first Sunday of the month,
      where the club invites potential recruits so that they can decide if they want to join.
