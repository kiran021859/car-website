    <h3>histrory</h3>
    <p>
      The Overberg Toyota Owners club is as new car club established on the 15 February 2019.
      The club started with a group of 5 friend who were tired of the of the sloppy car clubs they were in.
      These car clubs were unorganised and the members did not participate in any of the clubs events,
      thus the clubs became uneventful and ultimately ended.
      The friends came together and decided to start their own car club where they would personally organise the club
      and members would have to participate.
      The club president Dylan Arendse and his friends quickly expanded the group to over 50 members by May,
      but faced some problems when some member started to argue amongst each other.
      The club president decided to kick out the troublesome members and recruit others.
      Through the later months the club grew and gained a renowned reputation of being well organised and well supported
      by the Overberg community.
      The club has still been thriving through the COVID-19 lockdown and has become a pillar in the Overberg community.
